# Using machine learning and satellite imagery to estimate aid's effect on wealth: comparing China and World Bank programs in Africa
Code in support of a thesis for a Masters of Computational Social Science at Link√∂ping University.

Overview:
- R: contains majority of the analysis code.  [main.R](https://github.com/cc50liu/ChinaWorldBankAidLocationSelectionAfrica/blob/main/R/main.R) shows the order the files are intended to be executed (but is not executable itself).  The code
  - writes .csv files to the ./data/interim directory which are read by later scripts.
  - writes maps, charts, and figures to a ./figures directory
  - reads shapefiles, aid project, and confounder data from a ./data directory
  - writes results to a ./results directory
- python: scripts used to download satellite imagery over DHS points to NAISS
- slurm:  scripts to exeucte long-running R scripts on NAISS
